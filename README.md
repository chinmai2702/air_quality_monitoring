# air_quality_monitoring

The main aim of this project is to develop a device which can monitor PPM in air in real time, tell the quality of air and log data to a remote server(ThingSpeak).

The air monitoring device developed in this project is based on Arduino Uno. The Arduino board connects with ThingSpeak platform using ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. The sensor used for monitoring the air pollution is MQ-135 gas sensor. The sensor data is also displayed on a character LCD.
